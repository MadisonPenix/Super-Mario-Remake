For Sprint 3, the team made significant progress compared to the last sprint. The team decided to pursue a more structured approach
to communication and collaboration. Holding weekly meetings improved the team's communication, which enhanced
productivity by clearly defining and delegating tasks to members. However, the team can still improve on meeting earlier
deadlines and communicating when a deadline is not going to be met.

The decision to meet on a weekly basis proved to be a correct decision towards team cohesion. These regular interactions allowed
updates, concerns, and tasks to be shared during a longer time session, allowing for more thoughtout solutions to occur. The
improved communication resulted in clearly defined tasks, ensuring that each member had a clearly defined role in the sprint.

Fall Break did interrupt the middle of the sprint, as the grader meeting was done hastily and there was not much progress being
made during the break. However, due to the earlier deadlines that the team had set, most of the big implementations had been roughly
programmed in, giving the groundwork for fixes/refactors in the following week.

Time management is something that the team can work on. While the weekly meetings alleviated some of this, these meetings need to be
backed up with completable timelines for the tasks. This was partially attempted during the first meeting of the sprint, but subsequent
meetings did not allocate timelines for tasks. This led to a similar time crunch to the previous sprint. 

To adjust for time management, members will attempt to proactively inform others when a deadline cannot be met. This ensures that
problems can be addressed before they impede progress. During the weekly meetings, an emphasis will be placed on establishing timelines
for tasks, ensuring that earlier deadlines can be met to give more time for refactoring.

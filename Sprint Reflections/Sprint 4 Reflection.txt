For Sprint 3, the team made significant progress with some delays. The team continued holding the weekly meetings,
although these meetings were mainly done virtually. These weekly meetings improved the team's communication. However,
due to some delays in meeting deadlines, the team had a massive merge conflict at the end of the sprint, indicating
the need to pursue eariler deadlines.

Keeping with what worked in Sprint 3, the team kept holding regular weekly meetings. This allowed the team to properly
communicate current conflicts that each member had and the next steps for the sprint.

Similar to Sprint 4, time management is something that the team can work on. While the weekly meetings alleviated some 
of this, we did not assign appropriate deadlines for the tasks. This resulted in progress delays, resulting in a massive
merge time crunch, similar to what the team experienced in Sprint 2. 

To adjust for time management, the team will consider rapidly adjusting priorities. If a certain feature is delayed
for too long, the team will prioritize the completion of this feature depending on its impact to the entire project.
For example, the HUD would have been prioritized sooner.

Code being Reviewed: Flagpole/Level Clear State
Author of .cs file: Joseph Daprano

- Good idea to not let player able to pause during this state
	- don't think it's implemented yet but the idea and indication of the plan to do so is nice
- Constructor looks normal, and sets up the player for the animation using pre-existing commands,
	which is nice to see instead of writing new code that didn't need to be written for it
- was wondering why viewportCenter couldn't just be a field and initialized in the constructor
	(where GraphicsDevice is already being used) but then I saw that it wasn't being used in the 
	Draw() method at all in the first place
	- I think this code comes from GameState and I'm not sure why it isn't being used there either,
		or whether there's any idea of what it'll be used for. I don't believe the Viewport center
		has to be initialized in Draw() anyways
- Update seems similar to Update in GameState, with the code that would be redundant for LevelClear
	to use being removed. I think it's good to keep the method similar among the game states, changing
	whatever's necessary
	- DescendFlagPoleAnimation is called at the top, so it's being called every time Update is
		called. DescendFlagpoleAnimation uses the player's y-position so it makes sense for Update to
		give it the updated position.
- UpdateCamera is simply taking the x-position of the player and checking if the player is past a 
	certain x-coordinate, and if it is, stop following the player so we don't go off-screen.
	- Simple, and roughly the same as how the beginning of levels work too (Camera doesn't start 
		following Mario until he reaches a certain x-coordinate)
- Class has notes indicating what needs to be changed/improved, but looks pretty nice now

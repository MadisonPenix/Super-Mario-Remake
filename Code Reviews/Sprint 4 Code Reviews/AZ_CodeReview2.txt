- Naming convention inconsistent. Use of snake case for some functions when using camel case the majority of the time
- Continue and Quit functions have one single purpose. Follows S in SOLID
- Update and Draw have single function to loop through components. Good for separating looping and the actual function.
- Constructor is very large. Could consider splitting up the work into several functions
- Magic strings would be problematic if we decide to change the text to something else
	- GameUtility will fix this "shotgun surgery"
- If we change where we want to place the text (ie no longer centered), the current implementation would make it difficult to do so
	- Possibility of using GameUtility for offsets instead of dividing by 2

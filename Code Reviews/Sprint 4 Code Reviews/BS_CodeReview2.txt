- Most have only gets which lets the class using to value to not modify it in runtime. This makes debugging easier.
- Some do have private sets so make sure to get rid of those in the future
- Could have some comments explaining what each data value mean, especially for some that have pixels/sec and things.
- All classes are singleton pattern which makes it much easier to access and less memory to use. Well done

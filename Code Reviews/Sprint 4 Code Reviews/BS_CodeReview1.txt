- Follows C# naming conventions and is very minimal code.
- Single Responsiblity code that demonstrates low coupling and high cohesion
- Most of the code is in Draw (as it is all text being updated), and others are methods to update text variables
- Provides a method for any use that can pad a number with zeros, very nice
- Almost completly data driven with some magic numbers at initialization of default values.
- Overall no complaints on code quality as it does its job and it does it well

Sprint 4
Code being reviewed: XMLHandler.cs (Underworld additions)
Author of code being reviewed: Brady Scott
Number of minutes: 20

- XMLHandler.cs (and other similar classes) added to new folder/namespace "LevelLoading", just adds some minor but nice-to-have organization to the project.

- New method names don't match originals' naming convention. New methods are PascalCase and old ones are camelCase 
	- PascalCase is C# convention so even though the naming is inconsistent I think the original methods should be changed to match your new ones

- Lines 167 & 262: attribute.Value.ToString() can just be attribute.Value (and e.Value for 262)

- Lot of nesting going on, which is hard to avoid with a parser
	- some if-statements can probably be inverted to help get rid of at least a bit of the nesting and enhance readability

- Line 315, is there a reason "Single" is used instead of "float"?

- Decent amount of comments describing parts of code, but some methods without any could definitely use them
	- could maybe use some more comments focusing more on the "why" than the "how"/"what" (for example, brief description of why "Single" was used)

- Couple magic numbers in some places, not sure if they've been removed in the UtilityClasses branch already

- Nitpicking aside, the class has obviously done well at its job of grabbing information from the XML and giving it to other classes
	- most of the methods for parsing are broken up into smaller methods which greatly enhances the readability instead of cramming everything in one big "parse" method.

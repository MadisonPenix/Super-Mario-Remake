Reviewing: Utility Classes Implementation
Author of .cs file: Aaron Zhang

    Good use of utility classes for handling camera magic numbers
    Same for goombas, blocks, sprites, states etc (all relatively similar)
    - Good adhering to formatting, capitalization conventions, etc.
    Good decision having the utility classes be singleton instances

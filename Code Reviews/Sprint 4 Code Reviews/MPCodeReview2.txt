Name of the .cs file being reviewed: IKoopaStateMachine.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Joseph Daprano

Time Taken To Review: 

Specific comments on code quality:
	- Interface is minimal and singular, which is good
	- Flipped Koopa is inherited from the state machine but does not really use any of the methods inherited from the interface,
	  maybe flipped states could be refactored to minimize the amount of unused methods, not just for Koopa but for all the enemy states
	- Update method of ShellKoopaStateMachine has a nested if statement, could use boolean logic to refactor into one if-else statement
	- Magic numbers need to go into the utility class

Sprint 3
Code being reviewed: XMLHandler.cs
Author of code: Joseph Daprano

Code Quality:

	- parseXMLTree has many branches, increases cyclomatic complexity of class
		- Cyc. Complexity value for method: 7
		- parseXMLGameObject also has complexity of 4; these two parsing methods are noticeably more complex than others
		- But given that the methods have to go through entire XML documents it isn't necessarily "unacceptably" complex, just something to optimize later if possible

	- Comment on line 115 about replacing magic numbers; good planning for future sprints

	- Use of dictionaries to store classes and game objects is solid 
		- Main dictionary stores type of class as key and a separate dictionary as value, which holds the game objects for the given class type
		- As far as XML is concerned, this is a nice way of storing everything and keeping them easily accessible
		
	- Not 100% sure where the specific values used in coordsToPixels come from for the calculations, but seems to work nicely

	- Use of WriteLine for debugging, simple and effective choice
		- Commented out correctly so the unnecessary code isn't run

	- Using attributes in parseXMLTree could be replaced with GetType(String) and could help remove the need for the dictionaries

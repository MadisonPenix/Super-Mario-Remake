    Naming conventions are fine, a lot of them are basic (not sure if that's the right word but I meant the stuff like "Type[] types", "ICommand cmd", etc. that aren't necessarily "descriptive" but I don't think they need to be much more than that and I'm not sure what to name them otherwise).
    Comments explaining each part of FillCollisionTable() help divide the code (increase readability) and are brief enough to keep things simple.
    Code is consistent throughout class. Similar code for adding different collision types to table are handled similarly, as expected.
    Cyclomatic complexity is kept low (no excessive indentation)
    Overall readability of class is solid, code is organized well

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

	- Methods and variables named appropriately and easily convey what they represent
	- Entire class has one purpose and each method has a clear purpose
	- Method comments desciptive enough to easily understand putpose of method
	- I like how there are also comments describing why certain code is not in the class,
	  this reduces ambiguity
	- Maybe a few comments to describe the purposes of the magic numbers, these may be 
	  placeholders however and taken out and placed in the level loader in the future

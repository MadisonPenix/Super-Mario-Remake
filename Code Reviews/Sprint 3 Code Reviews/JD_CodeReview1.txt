Functionality:

    Overall looks pretty good, things fall in good arcs
    It does look like mario can double jump, not sure if that was intentional or accidental
    have to see it merged with collisisons to really see how it works but good so far

Code Quality:

    looks good overall, sleek and minimal code
    follows proper naming and capitalization conventions and uses comments where necessary but not where they are not

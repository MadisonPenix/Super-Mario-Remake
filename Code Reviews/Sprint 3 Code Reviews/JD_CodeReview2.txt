Sprint 3
Code being reviewed: MenuState.cs
Author of code: Ella Langenderfer

- Functionality: 
	- menus seem to work well, font is accurate to game
	- game should start not paused, but unsure how to fix the crashing that happens if we do that
	- Perhaps some kind of message about a future feature when clicking the 2-player game button on the start menu
		instead of just nothing happening

- Code Quality:
	- capitalization and naming conventions are followed appropriately
	- perhaps add a bit more whitespace for readability between sections of the code, it can be a little hard to read
	- good minimalist implementation for functionality

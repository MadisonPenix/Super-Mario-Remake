    Good protection of variable hasInput. Reduces coupling by only being able to request the value of the variable instead of directly reaching into the class
    It seems hasInput is always going to be true, since the else-statement assigns hasInput = true. Is it supposed to be else-if? Otherwise, there doesn't seem to be a reason to ever mark hasInput as false.
    Considering cardinality, it seems that each controller is coupled to one instance of Mario. Allows for multiple players since each player will have their own controller.
    If we decided to implement multiple controllers for one Mario, the current implementation will be difficult to maintain. We will need more if-statements. Consider data driving the Update() method by iterating through a list of controllers.
    PlayerIndex.One indicates this is only for player 1. May be an issue for multiple players, since not everyone will be player 1.
    Seems that KeyboardControls also implements Vibrate() (no actual code present since keyboards do not vibrate). Could instead just call a list of the controllers and tell them to vibrate if connected. Currently, this only checks one gamepad for vibration.

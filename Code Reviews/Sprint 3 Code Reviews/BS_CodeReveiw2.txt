Code Readability:

	- good use of comments. not too many where it's unreadable but enough to where
	I get the general gist of whats happening.

	- good naming of variables. it makes it very easy to understand what does what.
	
	- maybe shorten Update method to be several smaller methods that run.
	This would make the code seem less and would make debugging easier.

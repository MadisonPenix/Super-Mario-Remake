-While I like how bowser only has ChangeDirection instead of having both FaceLeft and FaceRight, 
    I can see how this implementation could cause issues in the future when trying to give bowser AI 
-There is a comment indicating that the bowser movement is a temporary implementation
-The variables and methods are named well; they are very clear
-In the future we can look towards giving bowser AI, instead of having the attack on a basic timer

Sprint 2
Name of .cs file: RightMovingGoomba.cs, LeftMovingGoomba.cs, FlippedGoomba.cs, StompedGoomba.cs
Author of .cs file: Joseph Daprano
Number of minutes: 25

Both:
- Line 13: Both files should be using the interface IEnemy instead of the concrete class Goomba
- Line 16: Same thing as before, use IEnemy

LeftMovingGoomba/RightMovingGoomba:
- Methods are named appropriately and make sense
- Method calls are simple to read
	- No comments necessary explaining what occurs in the method

FlippedGoomba/StompedGoomba:
- Methods with no code have sufficient comments to describe why the method is empty
- Behavior is too similar between these states
- FlippedGoomba may need code for changing the position of the Goomba

- Not fully sure what the practical differences are between active and inactive question blocks; the classes look mostly identical

- Good following of naming and capitalization conventions; some of the names of states and sprites are a bit long (CrackedBrickBlockDefaultState, etc.)
	but other than that code is easy to read and understand

- Ignore this if you have a valid reason for setting it up this way, but there seems to be a lot of duplicate code between the classes
	with maybe the Interactable boolean being changed

- BlockList class looks good, not sure if it works at the time of my writing this but it seems like it should be fine.

Name of .cs file: KeyboardController.cs

- Should have explicit permission modifiers on internal variables
	- Are these public or private?
- Line 32-39: Use of concrete classes instead of the interface
	- Should be using ICommand as the type
- Constructor is too long
	- Recommend instantiating and filling the keyMap dictionary in another method
- Unsure why initialize method exists; nothing ever calls it

- Hypothetical change: addition of the mouse as a controller for Mario
	- Current implementation can support this change
	- Since the dictionary only cares about keys -> action, this dictionary can be reused for mouse keys
	- Would only need to add the dictionary.add lines for the mouse keys; no other lines are needed

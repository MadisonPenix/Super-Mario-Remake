Name of .cs file: Mario State Concrete Classes (regMario, bigMario, fireMario, etc)
Author of .cs file: Aaron Zhang

- to decrease state explosion, may want to do a Mario state machine instead or some hybrid approach
	between pure state pattern and pure state machine

- May want to pull Update and Draw methods out of states altogether for reasons discussed in class code review

- DeadMario.cs:
	- should implement some kind of falling off the screen

- In big mario and fire mario states, when mario takes damage when running he goes down a health level but keeps running;
	I think in the game he kind of freezes for a second before being able to move again

- Not entirely sure, but I think there are some things that can fully kill fire mario or big mario (certain fires,
	projectiles, etc.), so should add checks as to how damage is being taken at some point

- Overall very sleek code, names are clear and concise which avoids need for excessive documentation or commenting

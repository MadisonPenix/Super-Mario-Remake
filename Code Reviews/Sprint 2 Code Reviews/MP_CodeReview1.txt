Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

	Coin.cs, ExtraLifeMushroom.cs, FireFlower.cs, InvicibilityStar.cs:
	- methods of class are very simple and easy to understand
	- great use of using comments for future implementations
	- a comment could be made for movementSpeed to clarify what variable is referring to

	FireFlower.cs, PowerMushroom.cs:
	- Two different constructors, could be a typo, or if not, needs a comment explaining the different uses for them

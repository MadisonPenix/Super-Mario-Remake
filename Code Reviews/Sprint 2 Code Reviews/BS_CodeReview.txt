Its all pretty readable because of how little code there is. Everything has a function within the code so theres no
code that is fluff. The draw function could use a few comments explaining why you get some variables but other than that
it is good.

Rows, Texture, and Columns can all be private variables. This code also assumes a lot about the art assets as
this code can only take a strip of sprites (starting from the top left of the sprite sheet) pre cut out.
The sprites are drawn at an arbitrary location given which helps make the code base more data driven.
This code also runs animation at every frame instead of at a given second interval.

The class could use a GameTime object passed in and have a double variable act as a timer. Essentially, the variable
would add how much time has passed since the last update call, then use that to see how long it has been (acting as a timer).
This, when compared to an amount of seconds can be used to increase the animation frame at certain intervals. This change
would be easy to implement with the person only having to create 2 private fields within the class and updating them every
update method.

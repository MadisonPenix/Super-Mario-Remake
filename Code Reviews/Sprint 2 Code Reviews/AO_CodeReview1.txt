- Naming conventions for members/fields and methods make sense and are named similarly to variables in other classes.
	- i.e. 'spriteWidth', 'spriteHeight' are similar to SpriteFactory's constants (ex: KOOPA_HEIGHT, KOOPA_WIDTH)

- Large number of fields leads to large number of parameters for the constructor, which can decrease readability a bit, though I'm not sure how to avoid it in this case.

- Code isn't overly complex and is relatively simple, there aren't many control statements.
	- Update() method has double-nested if-statements, but even then that isn't really a problem. It's just the most "complex" bit in terms of control flow but doesn't take away from the code's readability.
	- Highest # of indentations = 3
		- There's nothing really wrong with three indentations, maybe if there was four or five then that might be a problem, but this looks good.

- Class size is under 100 lines even with a comfortable amount of white space which helps make the entire class much more readable.

- Code is well-written and easy to understand as a person with very little prior C# experience.
	- I guess if I could say anything about it, it would be to add more comments, but I think most of the class is easy to understand just from looking at the names of variables and methods.
	- I wasn't sure what isFlipped was for at first, but that's really the only one I was confused about.

- Overall thoughts: very simple/easy to understand yet functional code. Only a few things I noticed and that was because I felt like I should nitpick whatever I could.

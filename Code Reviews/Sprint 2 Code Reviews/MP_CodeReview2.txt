Sprint number: 2

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: SpriteFactory.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Aaron Zhang

Specific comments on code quality:
	- private members of the class are grouped together, using single spritesheets for each type of sprite is good practice
	- Lots of constants, could be read from a textfile in the future to save space and increase readability
	- including different character specs will help with future collision handling
	- good use of comments to divide up sprite categories
	- overall extremely long, could possibly be refactored into smaller classes based on sprite categories
	- a lot of repeated code that could be refactored within each method

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	- In the future, could include more characters of Mario within the game such as more enemies. The current implementation could support this but 
		would only add to the problem of increasing file length and possibly repeated code
